> Master networking, APIs, and web protocols from the ground up. Build a solid foundation for modern web development!

## 📚 What You'll Learn

This comprehensive course covers everything from how the Internet works to building and securing production-ready APIs.

### Core Topics

- 🌍 **Internet Fundamentals**: How data travels, IP addresses, DNS, network layers
- 🌐 **Web Basics**: Client-server architecture, URLs, how browsers work
- 🛠️ **Developer Tools**: Browser DevTools, Postman, curl, HTTPie
- 📡 **HTTP Protocol**: Request/response cycle, methods, status codes, headers
- 🔌 **APIs**: REST design, authentication, security, real-world usage
- 🔐 **Security**: Input validation, rate limiting, CORS, SQL injection protection, XSS protection
- ⚡ **Real-Time**: WebSockets for live communication
- 🔒 **HTTPS/TLS**: Encryption, certificates, man-in-the-middle attacks

### 🔒 Security-First Approach

Unlike traditional networking courses that treat security as an afterthought, this course integrates security practices throughout every module. You'll learn to build secure systems from day one, not retrofit security later.

**Security Integration by Module:**

- **Module 01 (Internet Basics)**: Understanding network security at the packet level, VPNs, secure routing
- **Module 02 (Web Basics)**: HTTPS vs HTTP, secure browser practices, understanding web vulnerabilities
- **Module 03 (Developer Tools)**: Secure debugging, protecting sensitive data in network traces
- **Module 04 (HTTP Fundamentals)**: Security headers, CORS, understanding security-related status codes
- **Module 05 (Working With APIs)**: Secure API key management, protecting credentials, HTTPS requirements
- **Module 06 (Authentication & Authorization)**: Session security, JWT best practices, OAuth 2.0 flows, credential storage
- **Module 07 (REST API Design)**: Designing secure APIs, versioning for security updates, rate limiting patterns
- **Module 08 (Databases for APIs)**: SQL injection prevention, secure database connections, query parameterization
- **Module 09 (API Security)**: Comprehensive security module - input validation, rate limiting, CORS, XSS, CSRF
- **Module 10 (WebSockets)**: Securing WebSocket connections, authentication for real-time apps
- **Module 11 (Other Protocols)**: SSH key management, secure FTP alternatives, understanding protocol vulnerabilities
- **Module 12 (HTTPS/TLS)**: Deep dive into encryption, certificate management, preventing MITM attacks
- **Module 13 (Security Best Practices)**: Defense in depth, security testing, incident response, compliance

**This is not just "DevOps" - it's DevSecOps in practice.**

Security is integrated as a core principle at every stage, not bolted on at the end. You'll develop a security-first mindset that will serve you throughout your career.

**Why Security First?**

- 🚨 **83% of organizations** experienced API security incidents in 2023
- 💰 **Average cost** of a data breach: $4.45 million
- ⚡ **Prevention is easier** than fixing security issues in production
- 🎯 **Employers value** developers who understand security from the ground up

## 🌟 Why Networking & APIs Matter

Understanding networking and APIs is fundamental for modern development:

### **Everything is Connected**

Modern applications don't exist in isolation. They communicate with:

- Frontend ↔ Backend
- Service ↔ Service (microservices)
- Your app ↔ Third-party APIs (payment, auth, maps)
- Client ↔ Server (web, mobile)

### **APIs are Everywhere**

APIs are the backbone of the modern web:

- Mobile apps communicate with servers via APIs
- Websites fetch data from APIs
- Different services in your application talk via APIs
- You integrate with external services (Stripe, Google, AWS) via APIs

### **Security is Critical**

With everything connected, security is paramount:

- Protect user data
- Prevent unauthorized access
- Defend against attacks (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
- Comply with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA)

### **Foundation for Advanced Topics**

This course provides the foundation for:

- Microservices architecture
- Cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- GraphQL and gRPC
- Serverless applications
- IoT and edge computing

### Why Learn Core Concepts First?

**Tool-Agnostic Skills**: By focusing on fundamentals, you can adapt to any tool:

- 🎯 **HTTP is HTTP**: Whether you use curl, Postman, or Insomnia
- 🔒 **Security principles**: Apply to all frameworks and languages
- 🏗️ **REST design**: Works with Express, FastAPI, Spring Boot, or any framework
- 🔑 **Auth concepts**: JWT and OAuth work the same across platforms

### Choosing Your Stack

After completing this course, you'll be ready to choose tools based on:

1. **Your Primary Language**
   - Python → FastAPI, Django REST Framework
   - JavaScript/TypeScript → Express.js, Fastify, NestJS
   - Java → Spring Boot
   - Go → Gin, Echo
   - C# → ASP.NET Core

2. **Your Scale Requirements**
   - Small projects → Simple frameworks, SQLite
   - Medium scale → PostgreSQL/MySQL, standard frameworks
   - Large scale → Cloud databases, API gateways, microservices

3. **Your Team's Expertise**
   - Choose tools your team knows or can learn quickly
   - Consider community size and documentation quality
   - Balance cutting-edge vs battle-tested

4. **Your Deployment Environment**
   - Cloud-native → Cloud provider services (AWS API Gateway, Azure Functions)
   - On-premise → Self-hosted solutions
   - Hybrid → Flexible, portable choices

### Course Focus: Transferable Knowledge

This course teaches you:

- ✅ **Concepts** that work everywhere (HTTP, REST, security)
- ✅ **Principles** that guide tool selection
- ✅ **Patterns** used across all platforms
- ✅ **Debugging skills** that transfer to any tool
- ✅ **Critical thinking** to evaluate new tools

**Not just "how to use Tool X"** but **"how to think about the problem Tool X solves"**

### Quick Tool Recommendations

**Starting a new API project?** Here are solid default choices:

- **Simple REST API**: FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)
- **Enterprise API**: Spring Boot (Java) or ASP.NET Core (C#)
- **Real-time API**: Socket.io (Node.js) or FastAPI WebSockets (Python)
- **GraphQL API**: Apollo Server (Node.js) or Strawberry (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (relational) or MongoDB (document)
- **Auth**: Auth0 or AWS Cognito (outsourced) or JWT + bcrypt (self-managed)

## ⚠️ Note About Old Content

This repository previously contained a DevOps course (Git, Docker, CI/CD, etc.). Those modules (00-Setup through 07-Security-Basics) are still available but deprecated. They contain a `DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md` file with more information.

The repository has been restructured to focus on networking and API fundamentals, which provides a better foundation for modern web development.
