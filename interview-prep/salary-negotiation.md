## Negotiation Tactics

### Before You Negotiate

**1. Know Your Worth**

- Research market rates
- Assess your skills and experience
- Identify your unique value
- Determine your walk-away number

**2. Understand Their Constraints**

- Company size and funding stage
- Budget cycles
- Level and band ranges
- Standard equity packages

**3. Build Your Case**

- Specific skills matching their needs
- Past accomplishments with metrics
- Unique experience or certifications
- Competitive offers (if applicable)

**4. Know What You Want**

Prioritize your asks:

1. Must-haves (deal breakers)
2. Nice-to-haves (negotiable)
3. Don't care (ignore)

### The Negotiation Process

**Step 1: Receive Initial Offer**

**Do:**

- Thank them for the offer
- Ask for time to review (24-48 hours is reasonable)
- Request written offer with full details
- Ask questions about components you don't understand

**Don't:**

- Accept immediately (even if it's great)
- Reject immediately (unless it's insulting)
- Negotiate on the spot without preparation
- Share your current salary (in most states, they can't ask)

**Step 2: Evaluate the Offer**

**Questions to answer:**

- How does it compare to market rate?
- How does total comp break down?
- What's the year 1 cash situation?
- What are the benefits worth?
- Are there growth opportunities?

**Step 3: Prepare Your Counter**

**Structure:**

1. Express enthusiasm for the role
2. Explain your value
3. Make your ask
4. Provide justification
5. Stay collaborative

**Example:**

"I'm very excited about this opportunity and the team. Based on my research of market rates for DevOps engineers with Kubernetes expertise in [city], and considering my 4 years of experience including [specific relevant accomplishment], I was hoping we could discuss the compensation package.

I was targeting a base salary of $130k-140k range. Given my background in [specific skills they need], I believe I can deliver significant value in [specific area]. Is there flexibility in the offer?"

**Step 4: Negotiate**

**Tactics:**

**Anchor High (but reasonable):**

- If they ask your expectations first, give a range above your target
- Example: Want $120k? Say $130k-145k

**Bundle Your Asks:**

- Don't negotiate each item separately
- Present complete package
- "I'd be ready to accept with base at $X, equity of $Y, and $Z sign-on bonus"

**Use Silence:**

- After making your ask, stop talking
- Let them respond
- Don't fill the silence with justification or backtracking

**Focus on Win-Win:**

- "I want to find a package that works for both of us"
- "What can we do to make this work?"
- Collaborative, not adversarial

**Be Willing to Walk:**

- But only if you mean it
- Don't bluff
- Have other options if possible

**Get Creative:**

If they can't move on salary:

- Equity
- Sign-on bonus
- Future review timeline
- Title/level
- Professional development budget
- Extra PTO
- Remote work flexibility
- Equipment/home office stipend

**Example Exchange:**

**You:** "Thanks for the offer. I'm excited about the role. I was hoping we could get to $140k base. Is there flexibility?"

**Them:** "Our range for this level tops out at $135k."

**You:** "I understand. Could we bridge the gap with a sign-on bonus or additional equity?"

**Them:** "We could do $10k sign-on and increase the RSU grant by $10k."

**You:** "That works. One other thing - could we set a 6-month review instead of annual? I'd like to demonstrate my impact and discuss growth."

**Them:** "That's reasonable. I can commit to that."

**You:** "Great. I think we have a deal."

### What's Negotiable

**Usually Negotiable:**

- Base salary (within band)
- Equity/options amount
- Sign-on bonus
- Relocation package
- Start date
- Title (sometimes)
- Review timeline
- Professional development budget

**Sometimes Negotiable:**

- Bonus percentage
- Remote work policy
- PTO (above minimum)
- Equipment/stipends
- Level/band (with strong case)

**Rarely Negotiable:**

- Benefits (health, 401k match)
- Standard company policies
- Vesting schedules
- Work location (if not remote)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Accepting First Offer Without Negotiation**

- Most offers have room for negotiation
- Companies expect you to negotiate
- You leave money on the table

**❌ Negotiating Too Aggressively**

- Demanding vs. collaborative
- Threatening to walk over small amounts
- Being rude or entitled

**❌ Revealing Your Current Salary**

- It anchors the negotiation low
- Focus on market rate and your value
- In many states, they legally can't ask

**❌ Lying About Competing Offers**

- Easy to verify, damages credibility
- If you have offers, use them honestly
- If you don't, focus on market rate

**❌ Focusing Only on Salary**

- Ignoring total compensation
- Not considering benefits
- Forgetting work-life balance and growth

**❌ Negotiating Without Preparation**

- Not researching market rates
- Not knowing your priorities
- Accepting first counter without thinking

**❌ Taking It Personally**

- It's business, not personal
- "No" doesn't mean they don't value you
- Stay professional regardless of outcome

### Scripts and Examples

**When They Ask Your Salary Expectations:**

**Option 1:** Deflect early in process

"I'd like to learn more about the role and team before discussing compensation. Could you share the budget range for this position?"

**Option 2:** Give researched range

"Based on my research for DevOps engineers with my experience in [city], I'm seeing ranges of $120k-145k. Does that align with your budget?"

**Option 3:** Turn it around

"I'm flexible on compensation depending on the overall package and growth opportunities. What range did you have in mind for this role?"

**When Presenting Your Counter:**

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: [Your Name] - Offer Discussion

Hi [Hiring Manager],

Thank you again for the offer. I'm very excited about joining [Company] and contributing to [specific project/team].

I've had a chance to review the offer in detail. Based on my research of market rates and my [X years] of experience with [specific relevant skills], I'd like to discuss the compensation package.

Specifically, I was hoping we could:
- Increase base salary to $135k (from $125k)
- Include a $15k sign-on bonus to offset my year-end bonus at current company

I believe my background in [specific accomplishment] will allow me to contribute immediately to [their need], and I'm confident I can deliver significant value in the first 6 months.

I'm committed to making this work and finding a package that reflects my value to the team. Do you have time for a call this week to discuss?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Phone Script:**

"Hi [Name], thanks for sending over the offer. I'm really excited about the opportunity.

I was hoping we could discuss the compensation package. Based on my research and my experience with [relevant skills], I was targeting a base around $130k-140k.

I know I can bring immediate value through [specific contribution], and I'm hoping we can get to a number that reflects that.

What are your thoughts? Is there room to move on the base salary?"

**When They Say "This Is Our Final Offer":**

**Option 1:** Test if it's really final

"I appreciate you sharing that. Before I give my decision, I want to make sure I understand - is there absolutely no flexibility on any component of the package?"

**Option 2:** Get creative

"I understand the constraints on base salary. Would there be flexibility in other areas like sign-on bonus, equity, or review timeline?"

**Option 3:** Accept or walk

"I appreciate your transparency. Let me take 24 hours to consider the full package and get back to you."

**When You Have Multiple Offers:**

**Do:**

- Be honest that you're considering other opportunities
- Use it as leverage politely
- Give timeline for decision

**Don't:**

- Play companies against each other aggressively
- Lie about offers
- Rush the process artificially

**Example:**

"I want to be transparent - I'm in late stages with another company. I'm most excited about your role because of [specific reasons], but I need to make sure the compensation is competitive. The other offer is at $140k base. Can we get closer to that range?"

## Special Situations

### Negotiating Your First DevOps Role

**Challenges:**

- Limited experience
- Smaller comp packages
- Less negotiating leverage

**Strategies:**

- Focus on eagerness to learn
- Highlight transferrable skills
- Negotiate for growth opportunities
- Ask for early review (3-6 months)
- Emphasize unique background

**Example:**

"I understand I'm earlier in my DevOps career, but I bring [unique background - e.g., development experience, specific technical skills]. I've researched market rates for junior DevOps engineers in [city] and I'm seeing $75k-85k. I was hoping we could target the higher end of that range given my [specific skill]. I'm also hoping we could schedule a 6-month review to discuss my progress and compensation."

### Negotiating Internal Promotion

**Challenges:**

- Company knows your current salary
- May have internal equity concerns
- Slower to adjust than external offers

**Strategies:**

- Research market rate for new level
- Document your expanded responsibilities
- Get external offers to show market value
- Time with performance review cycle
- Focus on role change, not just title

**Example:**

"I'm excited about the senior DevOps engineer promotion. I've researched market rates for senior engineers with my responsibilities, and I'm seeing $130k-150k. Currently I'm at $105k. I understand internal promotions have smaller jumps, but this represents a significant role change - I'll be leading the Kubernetes migration and mentoring two junior engineers. Can we discuss bridging more of that gap?"

### Negotiating Remote Work Compensation

**Scenarios:**

1. **Remote role in same location**: Full local market rate
2. **Remote role in lower COL area**: May offer less than HQ rate
3. **Converting in-office to remote**: Usually no salary change

**If they offer location-based adjustment:**

**Their argument:**

- Lower cost of living in your area
- Market rate for your location
- Internal equity with other remote workers

**Your counter:**

- You deliver same value regardless of location
- Many companies pay uniform rates for remote
- Competing offers don't adjust for location
- Your expenses (home office, internet) are higher remote

**Example:**

"I understand the reasoning for location-based compensation. However, I'm delivering the same value to the company regardless of where I sit. Many tech companies, including [examples], pay uniform rates for remote positions. Additionally, I have higher expenses working remotely - home office setup, internet, equipment. I'd like to be compensated at the [HQ city] rate of $140k rather than the adjusted $120k."

### Negotiating Equity-Heavy Offers (Startups)

**Questions to ask:**

- What's the current valuation?
- What % of company do my options represent?
- What's the strike price?
- What's the vesting schedule and cliff?
- What happens to my options if I leave?
- What's the typical dilution in future rounds?
- What's the exit timeline expectation?
- Can I see the option grant agreement?

**Evaluating the offer:**

**Conservative approach:** Assume options are worth $0

- Focus on cash compensation
- Treat equity as potential upside
- Make sure base salary covers your needs

**Optimistic approach:** Estimate potential value

- Research similar companies' exit multiples
- Consider dilution from future rounds
- Calculate potential return
- Factor in risk and timeline

**Example calculation:**

- 20,000 options at $1 strike
- 0.15% of company
- Current valuation: $50M
- Potential exit: $200M in 5 years

**Optimistic:** (0.15% of $200M) - ($20k cost) = $280k gain
**Realistic:** Account for dilution (50%), down round risk = $100k gain
**Conservative:** $0

**Negotiation approach:**

"I'm excited about the equity package and the company's potential. Given the risk and uncertainty of options, I'd like to increase the base salary to $130k. Alternatively, could we increase the option grant to 25,000 shares to compensate for the below-market base?"

### Negotiating as Senior/Staff+ Engineer

**Higher stakes:**

- Larger compensation packages
- More complex negotiations
- Greater impact on company
- More components to negotiate

**Leverage points:**

- Specialized expertise
- Leadership ability
- Proven track record
- External offers
- Strategic importance to company

**Additional negotiation points:**

- Level/title (senior vs. staff vs. principal)
- Reporting structure
- Team size/composition
- Budget authority
- Strategic input
- Conference speaking opportunities
- Technical decision authority

**Example:**

"I'm very interested in this staff engineer role. I'd like to discuss a few aspects of the package:

1. Compensation: Given my 8 years of Kubernetes experience at scale and my work on [major project], I'm targeting $190k base + $100k/year equity, which aligns with market for staff-level at [competing companies].

2. Team: Can we discuss the team composition? I'd like to work with senior engineers who I can learn from and collaborate with.

3. Impact: What's the scope of influence for this role? I want to ensure I can drive technical strategy, not just implementation.

4. Growth: What does the path to principal engineer look like?

Can we schedule time to discuss these points?"

---

## After Accepting the Offer

### Get Everything in Writing

**Offer letter should include:**

- Base salary
- Equity details (amount, vesting schedule, type)
- Bonus structure
- Start date
- Title
- Benefits summary
- Any special agreements (review timeline, remote work, etc.)
- Sign-on bonus and clawback terms
- Relocation package details

**If anything agreed verbally isn't in writing:**

"Thanks for the offer letter. I notice it doesn't mention the 6-month review we discussed. Can we add that?"

### Resigning Professionally

**Don't:**

- Burn bridges
- Badmouth current company
- Brag about new compensation
- Slack off during notice period
- Take company property/data

**Do:**

- Give appropriate notice (2 weeks standard)
- Offer to help transition
- Document your work
- Be professional
- Thank people who helped you
- Stay positive

**Resignation Letter Template:**

```
[Date]

Dear [Manager],

I'm writing to inform you of my resignation from [Company]. My last day will be [date - typically 2 weeks].

I've accepted a position that will allow me to [grow in specific direction]. This was a difficult decision, as I've enjoyed working with this team and learned a great deal.

I'm committed to making this transition as smooth as possible. I'll work with you to document my projects and assist in knowledge transfer.

Thank you for the opportunities I've had here.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Handling Counter-Offers

**Why companies counter-offer:**

- Cheaper than hiring replacement
- Avoid project disruption
- Time to find replacement

**Why you should be cautious:**

- Original problems still exist
- Trust may be broken ("looking to leave")
- Often temporary fix
- Statistically, most who accept counter-offers leave within a year

**Evaluate counter-offer:**

- Does it address why you were leaving?
- Is it genuine or buying time?
- What's the long-term career impact?
- How does it compare to new opportunity?

**Usually better to decline:**

"I appreciate the counter-offer, and I'm grateful for my time here. However, I've made my decision based on [career growth, new challenges, etc.], and I'm committed to this new opportunity."

- Build track record of impact at each company

### When to Ask for a Raise

**Timing:**

- Annual review cycle
- After major accomplishment
- When taking on significantly more responsibility
- When market rates have increased substantially
- When you receive external offer

**How often:**

- Comparable roles at other companies
- Industry salary surveys

**3. Expand Responsibilities:**

- Demonstrate you're operating at next level
- Taking on more complex projects
- Mentoring others
- Strategic contributions

**4. Get External Validation:**

- Interview at other companies
- Get competing offers
- Talk to recruiters about market rate

**Example Request:**

"I'd like to schedule time to discuss my compensation. Over the past year, I've [led the Kubernetes migration, mentored 3 junior engineers, reduced incident response time by 40%]. I've researched market rates for senior DevOps engineers with my experience, and I'm seeing $140k-160k. I'm currently at $125k. Based on my impact and market rates, I believe an adjustment to $145k is appropriate. Can we discuss this?"

### Equity Management

**RSUs:**

- Automatic vesting (less to manage)
- Tax withheld at vest
- Consider tax burden each vest period
- Decide: hold or sell?

**Stock Options:**

- Plan for exercise cost
- Understand tax implications (ISOs vs. NSOs)
- Exercise before leaving if valuable
- Monitor company valuation
- Have liquidity plan

**ESPP:**

- Usually good deal (15% discount)
- Quick sell if you need cash
- Hold if you believe in company (but don't over-concentrate)
- Understand tax treatment (qualifying vs. disqualifying disposition)

**Concentration Risk:**

- Don't hold too much company stock
- General rule: < 10% of net worth in single stock
- Especially important if your salary also depends on company

### Career Pivots for Higher Compensation

**Paths that typically increase compensation:**

**1. IC → Management**

- Typically 10-20% increase
- Higher ceiling at senior levels
- More responsibility
- Different skill set

**2. Generalist → Specialist**

- Deep expertise commands premium
- Examples: Kubernetes expert, Security specialist, SRE
- Smaller job market but higher pay

## Negotiation Mindset

### Remember

**You Are Providing Value**

- Companies hire you to solve problems
- Your skills have market value
- Good companies want to pay fairly
- Negotiation is expected and respected

**It's a Business Transaction**

- Both sides want fair deal
- Professional negotiation is normal
- Saying "no" is okay

**Knowledge Is Power**

- Research market rates
- Know your worth
- Understand their constraints
- Prepare your case

**Everything Is Negotiable**

- Except when it's not
- Ask, worst they say is no
- Get creative with components
- Bundle your asks

### Building Confidence

**Practice:**

- Role-play with friends
- Practice scripts
- Get comfortable with numbers
- Expect counteroffers

**Have Options:**

- Interview at multiple companies
- Don't rely on single offer
- Options give leverage
- Reduces desperation

**Focus on Fit:**

- Money isn't everything
- Find right opportunity
- Consider growth, culture, mission
- Be willing to walk for right reasons

### Final Thoughts

**Negotiation is a skill** - You get better with practice.

**Most offers have room** - Companies expect negotiation and build in buffer.

**Be collaborative** - Win-win outcomes are best.

**Know your worth** - Research market rates and value your skills.

**Get it in writing** - Verbal promises aren't binding.

**Think long-term** - Consider growth, learning, and career trajectory.

**Don't be afraid** - The worst they can say is no, and you're back to the original offer.

**Advocate for yourself** - No one else will negotiate on your behalf.

**Remember:** You're entering a partnership with the company. Good companies want you to feel valued and fairly compensated. Negotiation is the first step in building that relationship.

Good luck with your negotiations! 💰🚀
