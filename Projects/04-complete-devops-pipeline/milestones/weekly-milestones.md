## Risk Management

### Common Risks

**Week 1 Risks:**
- Scope too large → Reduce to MVP
- Architecture unclear → Seek review

**Week 2 Risks:**
- Behind schedule → Focus on core features
- Technical issues → Ask for help early

**Week 3 Risks:**
- DevOps complexity → Follow tutorials
- Integration problems → Test incrementally

**Week 4 Risks:**
- Documentation incomplete → Start early
- Demo not ready → Prepare backup

---
