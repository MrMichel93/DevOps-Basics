# Project 2 Starter Code

## Overview

This directory provides the foundation for building a full-stack application with Docker Compose.

## What's Provided

- Basic React frontend structure
- Express backend with API endpoints
- PostgreSQL database schema
- Nginx configuration template

## Your Task

1. Create Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
2. Write docker-compose.yml orchestrating all services
3. Configure Nginx as reverse proxy
4. Set up networking between services
5. Implement data persistence
6. Configure development and production modes

## Getting Started

Follow the main project instructions and checkpoints.md for step-by-step guidance.

## Structure

```
starter-code/
├── frontend/          # React application
├── backend/           # Express API
├── nginx/            # Nginx configuration
└── db/               # Database initialization
```

Each directory contains base code to build upon. Your job is to containerize and orchestrate these services!
