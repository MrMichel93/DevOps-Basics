# DevOps Projects

## 🎯 Overview

These hands-on projects integrate everything you've learned. Each project builds on previous modules and simulates real-world DevOps scenarios.

**Approach:** Start with Project 1 and progress sequentially. Each project should take 4-8 hours.

## 📋 Projects

### [Project 1: Containerize an Existing App](./01-containerize-existing-app.md)

**Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Prerequisites:** Modules 00-03  
**Skills:** Docker, Dockerfile best practices, docker-compose

Take a simple web application and containerize it properly:

- Write optimized Dockerfile
- Create docker-compose setup
- Implement health checks
- Add volume mounts for development

**Outcome:** Fully containerized application ready for deployment.

### [Project 2: Full-Stack with Docker Compose](./02-full-stack-with-compose.md)

**Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Prerequisites:** Modules 00-03  
**Skills:** Multi-container apps, networking, volumes, environment management

Build a complete three-tier application:

- React frontend
- Node.js/Express backend API
- PostgreSQL database
- Nginx reverse proxy
- Docker Compose orchestration

**Outcome:** Production-like multi-container application with proper networking and data persistence.

### [Project 3: Complete CI/CD Pipeline](./03-ci-cd-pipeline.md)

**Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Prerequisites:** Modules 00-04  
**Skills:** GitHub Actions, automated testing, Docker builds, deployment automation

Implement comprehensive CI/CD:

- Automated testing on every commit
- Linting and code quality checks
- Docker image builds
- Multi-stage deployments (staging, production)
- Automated rollbacks

**Outcome:** Fully automated deployment pipeline with quality gates.

### [Project 4: Build a Complete DevOps Pipeline](./04-complete-devops-pipeline.md)

**Time:** 12-16 hours  
**Prerequisites:** All modules  
**Skills:** Everything learned in the course

Build a production-ready application from scratch with complete DevOps practices:

- Choose your own application (provided suggestions)
- Complete DevOps workflow:
  - Version control with Git
  - Containerization with Docker
  - CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
  - Infrastructure as Code
  - Monitoring and logging
  - Comprehensive security implementation
  - Complete documentation
  - Presentation component

**Outcome:** Portfolio-ready capstone project demonstrating mastery of all DevOps skills.

## 🏆 Project Structure

Each project now includes comprehensive learning resources:

### Core Components
