# ⚠️ DEPRECATION NOTICE

This module is part of the **old DevOps course structure** and is being kept for backwards compatibility.

## 📢 Important Update

This repository has been restructured to focus on **Networking and API Fundamentals**.

The old DevOps modules (00-Setup through 07-Security-Basics) are being deprecated in favor of a new course structure focusing on networking, APIs, and web protocols.

## 🔄 New Course Structure

The repository now contains:

- **00-Prerequisites**: Environment setup for networking/APIs
- **01-Internet-Basics**: How the Internet works
- **02-How-The-Web-Works**: Clients, servers, and browsers
- **03-Developer-Tools-Setup**: Browser DevTools, Postman, curl
- **04-HTTP-Fundamentals**: Request/response, methods, status codes
- **05-Working-With-APIs**: Practical API consumption
- **06-Authentication-and-Authorization**: Auth mechanisms
- **07-REST-API-Design**: RESTful principles
- **08-Databases-for-APIs**: Data persistence
- **09-API-Security**: Security best practices
- **10-WebSockets**: Real-time communication
- **11-Other-Protocols**: TCP/UDP, FTP, SMTP, SSH
- **12-HTTPS-and-TLS**: Encryption and certificates
- **13-Network-Security-Best-Practices**: Comprehensive security

## 📚 Additional Resources

- `debugging-exercises/`: Tool-specific practice
- `api-examples/`: Sample APIs
- `security-labs/`: Hands-on security exercises

- `interview-prep/`: Networking interview questions

## 🗺️ Migration Guide

If you were following the old DevOps course:

- The content in this folder is still valid and functional
- You can complete this module if you wish
- The new networking/API course is independent and can be followed separately
- Both courses teach valuable skills for modern developers

## ⏱️ Deprecation Timeline

- **Current**: Old modules available with deprecation notice
- **Next Version**: Old modules will be moved to a separate branch
- **Future**: May be archived completely
